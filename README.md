#### 1.AGE,GENDER DETECTION
# NullClass-Internship-Tasks-1
This repository contains a project for predicting age and gender using deep learning with the UTKFace dataset.
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of faces into age and gender categories. The dataset used is UTKFace, a large-scale dataset of facial images with age, gender, and ethnicity labels.

Features
- Gender Classification (Male/Female)
- Age Prediction (Numerical)

### ANIMAL DETECTION APP
This repository contains the code for detecting carnivorous and other animals in images and videos using the YOLOv8 model. It also includes a simple GUI to make the process user-friendly.
This project utilizes a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and classify animals in images and videos. It highlights carnivorous animals with red bounding boxes and others with green. The project also features a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
Features
- Detect animals in images and videos.
- Highlight carnivorous animals in red and others in green.
- Display the count of carnivorous animals detected.
- Simple GUI for selecting input files.

### AGE AND EMOTION DETECTION
This project is a real-time age and emotion detection system built using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and pre-trained models. It detects faces in a video stream, predicts their age group and emotion, and logs relevant data.
Features
- Detects age group and emotion from live webcam feed.
- Highlights individuals based on age group:
  - Not Allowed: `(0-2)`, `(8-12)`, `(60-100)`
  - Allowed: All other age groups, with emotion detection.
- Logs age, emotion, and entry time into a CSV file.
